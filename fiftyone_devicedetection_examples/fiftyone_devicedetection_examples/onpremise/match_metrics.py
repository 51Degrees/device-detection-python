## @example onpremise/match_metrics.py
#
# The example illustrates the various metrics that can be obtained about the device detection
# process, for example, the degree of certainty about the result. Running the example outputs
# those properties and values.

# The example also illustrates controlling properties that are returned from the detection
# process - reducing the number of components required to return the properties requested reduces
# the overall time taken.
# 
# There is a (discussion)[https://51degrees.com/documentation/_device_detection__hash.html#DeviceDetection_Hash_DataSetProduction_Performance]
# of metrics and controlling performance on our web site. See also the (performance options)
# [https://51degrees.com/documentation/_device_detection__features__performance_options.html]
# page.
# # Location
# This example is available in full on (GitHub)[https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-python/blob/master/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/onpremise/match_metrics.py].
