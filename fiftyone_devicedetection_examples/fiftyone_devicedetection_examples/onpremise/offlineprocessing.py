## @example onpremise/offlineprocessing.py
# 
# Provides an example of processing a YAML file containing evidence for device detection. 
# There are 20,000 examples in the supplied file of evidence representing HTTP Headers.
# For example:
# 
# ```
# header.user-agent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36'
# header.sec-ch-ua: '" Not A;Brand";v="99", "Chromium";v="98", "Google Chrome";v="98"'
# header.sec-ch-ua-full-version: '"98.0.4758.87"'
# header.sec-ch-ua-mobile: '?0'
# header.sec-ch-ua-platform: '"Android"'
# ```
# 
# We create a device detection pipeline to read the data and find out about the associated device,
# we write this data to a YAML formatted output stream.
# 
# As well as explaining the basic operation of off line processing using the defaults, for
# advanced operation this example can be used to experiment with tuning device detection for
# performance and predictive power using Performance Profile, Graph and Difference and Drift 
# settings.
# 
# This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-python/blob/master/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/onpremise/offlineprocessing.py).
