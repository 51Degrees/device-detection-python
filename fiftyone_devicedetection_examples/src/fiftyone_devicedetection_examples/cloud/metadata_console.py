## @example cloud/metadata_console.py
#
# The cloud service exposes meta data that can provide additional information about the various 
# properties that might be returned.
# This example shows how to access this data and display the values available.
# 
# A list of the properties will be displayed, along with some additional information about each
# property. Note that this is the list of properties used by the supplied resource key, rather
# than all properties that can be returned by the cloud service.
# 
# In addition, the evidence keys that are accepted by the service are listed. These are the 
# keys that, when added to the evidence collection in flow data, could have some impact on the
# result that is returned.
# 
# Bear in mind that this is a list of ALL evidence keys accepted by all products offered by the 
# cloud. If you are only using a single product (for example - device detection) then not all
# of these keys will be relevant.
# 
# This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-python/blob/main/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/cloud/metadata_console.py).
