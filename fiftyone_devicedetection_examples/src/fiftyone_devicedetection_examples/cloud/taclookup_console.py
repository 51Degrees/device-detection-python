## @example cloud/taclookup_console.py
# @brief TAC Lookup Console Example - Cloud
#
# This example shows the details of devices associated with a given 'Type Allocation Code' or 'TAC'.
# More background information on TACs can be found through various online sources such as Wikipedia: 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Allocation_Code
#
# You will learn:
# 1. How to create a Pipeline that uses the 51Degrees cloud service for TAC lookup
# 2. How to pass a TAC as evidence to the Pipeline
# 3. How to retrieve device details associated with the TAC
#
# This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-python/blob/version/4.5/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/src/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/cloud/taclookup_console.py).
