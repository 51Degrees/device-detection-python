## @example cloud/nativemodellookup_console.py
# 
# This example shows how to use the 51Degrees Cloud service to lookup the details of a device 
# based on a given 'native model name'. Native model name is a string of characters that are 
# returned from a query to the device's OS. 
# There are different mechanisms to get native model names for 
# [Android devices](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#MODEL) and 
# [iOS devices](https://gist.github.com/soapyigu/c99e1f45553070726f14c1bb0a54053b#file-machinename-swift)
# 
# This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-python/blob/main/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/src/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/cloud/nativemodellookup_console.py).
