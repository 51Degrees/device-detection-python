## @example onpremise/datafileupdate_console.py
#
# This example illustrates various parameters that can be adjusted when using the on-premise
# device detection engine, and controls when a new data file is sought and when it is loaded by
# the device detection software.
#
# Three main aspects are demonstrated:
# - Update on Start-Up
# - Filesystem Watcher
# - Daily auto-update
#
# ## License Key
# In order to test this example you will need a 51Degrees Enterprise license which can be
# purchased from our [pricing page](//51degrees.com/pricing/annual). Look for our "Bigger" or
# "Biggest" options.
#
# # Data Files
# You can find out more about data files, licenses etc. at our [FAQ page](//51degrees.com/resources/faqs)
#
# ## Enterprise Data File
# Enterprise (fully-featured) data files are typically released by 51Degrees four days a week
# (Mon-Thu) and on-premise deployments can fetch and download those files automatically. Equally,
# customers may choose to download the files themselves and move them into place to be detected
# by the 51Degrees filesystem watcher.
#
# ### Manual Download
# If you prefer to download files yourself, you may do so here:
# ```
# https://distributor.51degrees.com/api/v2/download?LicenseKeys=<your_license_key>&Type=27&Download=True&Product=22
# ```
#
# ## Lite Data File
# Lite data files (free-to-use, limited capabilities, no license key required) are created roughly
# once a month and cannot be updated using auto-update, they may be downloaded from
# [Github](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-data) and are included with
# source distributions of this software.
#
# # Update on Start-Up
# You can configure the pipeline builder to download an Enterprise data file on start-up.
# ## Pre-Requisites
# - a license key
# - a file location for the download
#      - this may be an existing file - which will be overwritten
#      - or if it does not exist must end in ".hash" and must be in an existing directory
# ## Configuration
# - the pipeline must be configured to use a temp file
# ``` {py}
#      create_temp_copy = True,
# ```
# - a DataFileUpdateService must be supplied
# ``` {py}
#      update_event = UpdateEvent()
#      update_service = DataFileUpdateService()
#      update_service.on_complete(lambda status, file: update_event.set(status))
#  ...
#      data_file_update_service = update_service,
# ```
# - update on start-up must be specified, which will cause pipeline creation to block until a
# file is downloaded
# ``` {py}
#      update_on_start = True,
# ```
#
# # File System Watcher
# You can configure the pipeline builder to watch for changes to the currently loaded device
# detection data file, and to replace the file currently in use with the new one. This is
# useful, for example, if you wish to download and update the device detection file "manually" -
# i.e. you would download it then drop it into place with the same path as the currently loaded
# file. That location is checked periodically (by default every 30 mins) and this frequency can be
# configured.
#
# ## Pre-Requisites
# - a license key
# - the file location of the existing file
# ## Configuration
# - the pipeline must be configured to use a temp file
# ``` {py}
#      create_temp_copy = True,
# ```
# - a DataFileUpdateService must be supplied
# ``` {py}
#      update_event = UpdateEvent()
#      update_service = DataFileUpdateService()
#      update_service.on_complete(lambda status, file: update_event.set(status))
#  ...
#      data_file_update_service = update_service,
# ```
# - configure the frequency with which the location is checked, in seconds (10 mins as shown)
# ``` {py}
#      polling_interval = (10*60),
# ```
#
# ## Daily auto-update
# Enterprise data files are usually created four times a week. Each data file contains a date
# for when the next data file is expected. You can configure the pipeline so that it starts
# looking for a newer data file after that time, by connecting to the 51Degrees distributor to
# see if an update is available. If one is, then it is downloaded and will replace the existing
# device detection file, which is currently in use.
#
# ## Pre-Requisites
# - a license key
# - the file location of the existing file
# ## Configuration
# - the pipeline must be configured to use a temp file
# ``` {py}
#      create_temp_copy = True,
# ```
# - a DataFileUpdateService must be supplied
# ``` {py}
#      update_event = UpdateEvent()
#      update_service = DataFileUpdateService()
#      update_service.on_complete(lambda status, file: update_event.set(status))
#  ...
#      data_file_update_service = update_service,
# ```
# - Set the frequency in seconds that the pipeline should check for updates to data files.
# A recommended polling interval in a production environment is around 30 minutes.
# ``` {py}
#      polling_interval = (10*60),
# ```
# - Set the max amount of time in seconds that should be added to the polling interval. This is
# useful in datacenter applications where multiple instances may be polling for  updates at the
# same time. A recommended ammount in production  environments is 600 seconds.
# ``` {py}
#      update_time_maximum_randomisation = (10*60),
# ```
