## @example onpremise/gettingstarted_console.py
# @brief Getting Started Console Example - On-premise
#
# This example shows how to use 51Degrees On-premise device detection to determine details 
# about a device based on its User-Agent and User-Agent Client Hint HTTP header values.
#
# You will learn:
# 1. How to create a Pipeline that uses 51Degrees On-premise device detection
# 2. How to pass input data (evidence) to the Pipeline
# 3. How to retrieve the results
#
# This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-python/blob/version/4.5/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/src/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/onpremise/gettingstarted_console.py).
