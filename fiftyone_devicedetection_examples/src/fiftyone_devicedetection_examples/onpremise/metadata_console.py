## @example onpremise/metadata_console.py
#
# The device detection data file contains meta data that can provide additional information
# about the various records in the data model.
# This example shows how to access this data and display the values available.
# 
# A list of the properties will be displayed, along with some additional information about each
# property.
# 
# Finally, the evidence keys that are accepted by device detection are listed. These are the 
# keys that, when added to the evidence collection in flow data, could have some impact on the
# result returned by device detection.
#
# This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-python/blob/main/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/onpremise/metadata_console.py).
