    <p>
    By default, the user-agent, sec-ch-ua and sec-ch-ua-mobile HTTP headers
    are sent.
    <br />
    This means that on the first request, the server can determine the
    browser from sec-ch-ua while other details must be derived from the
    user-agent.
    <br />
    If the server determines that the browser supports client hints, then
    it may request additional client hints headers by setting the
    Accept-CH header in the response.
    <br />
    Select the <strong>Make second request</strong> button below,
    to use send another request to the server. This time, any
    additional client hints headers that have been requested
    will be included.

        // with the properties, it will also send a new header field Accept-CH in response indicating the additional
        // evidence it needs. It builds the new response header using SetHeader[Component name]Accept-CH properties 
        // where Component Name is the name of the component for which properties are required.
        // 3. When "Make second request" button will be clicked, device detection request will again 
        // be sent to the server with all additional client hints that was requested in the previous
        // response by the server.
